In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when using the `useParams` hook within a component nested deeply within other route components. If the parent routes don't have their own corresponding `<Outlet />` components, the nested route component won't receive the expected parameters.  This is because the parameter resolution happens higher up the route tree, and if the parent routes aren't set up to pass down the parameters through `<Outlet />`, the nested component won't have access to them.  The `useParams` hook will return an empty object, resulting in unexpected behavior or errors.
